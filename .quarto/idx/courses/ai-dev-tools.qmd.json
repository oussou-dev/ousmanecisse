Here's what I learned:\n\n#### **Frontend-First Approach with AI**\n\nWe started by using **Lovable** (or similar AI tools like Bolt, Cursor, or Claude Code) to rapidly scaffold a multiplayer Snake game in React with TypeScript. The key insight: rather than starting with backend logic, we built an interactive frontend first, complete with mockups for authentication, leaderboards, and live gameplay. This frontend-first strategy shifts how you think about API contracts — you build the UI you want, *then* design the backend to serve it.\n\nThe prompt engineering for frontend was crucial: describing the app's features (game modes, multiplayer mechanics, testing coverage) helped the AI generate a cohesive, testable codebase. The lesson: **clear requirements lead to better code generation**.\n\n#### **API-First Backend Design with OpenAPI**\n\nOnce the frontend was done, we didn't write the backend arbitrarily. Instead, we:\n\n1. **Extracted OpenAPI specifications** from the frontend code — documenting what API endpoints and data structures the frontend actually needs\n2. **Generated a FastAPI backend** directly from those specs\n\nThis \"API contract first\" approach ensures frontend and backend stay synchronized and prevents wasted effort on unused endpoints. I learned that **OpenAPI is a powerful bridge between AI-generated frontend and backend** — it forces both to speak the same language.\n\n#### **Database Integration & Real-World Concerns**\n\nInitially we mocked the database, then we integrated **SQLAlchemy** with **PostgreSQL and SQLite**. This introduced important real-world considerations:\n\n- **Integration testing**: We wrote separate integration tests (not just unit tests) that spin up a SQLite database and verify the full data flow works\n- **Schema management & migrations**: Real databases require careful handling of data persistence and schema changes\n- **Testing strategy**: Mock databases for unit tests, real databases for integration tests\n\nI realized that many junior developers skip this, but it's critical for production apps.\n\n#### **Containerization & Local Development**\n\nWe containerized everything using **Docker Compose**, bundling:\n\n- Frontend (served via Nginx)\n- Backend (FastAPI)\n- Database (PostgreSQL)\n\nThis forced me to think about:\n- Environment configuration\n- Service networking and communication\n- Build processes and dependencies\n- Running everything locally in a reproducible way\n\nRunning `docker-compose up --build` felt like magic — suddenly an entire application stack worked locally, exactly as it would in production.\n\n#### **Deployment to the Cloud**\n\nWe deployed to **Render**, combining frontend and backend into a single container. The workflow:\n\n1. Build a single Docker image with both services\n2. Push to a cloud platform (we chose Render for simplicity)\n3. Let the platform handle scaling, SSL, and management\n\nThis demystified \"DevOps\" — it's really just containerizing intelligently and picking a platform that abstracts infrastructure away.\n\n#### **CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions**\n\nThe final piece was automating everything:\n\n1. **Run tests** (frontend + backend) on every push\n2. **Run integration tests** separately\n3. **Deploy automatically** to Render if tests pass\n\nThis creates a **safety net** — bad code can't accidentally get deployed. We learned that CI/CD pipelines, while seeming complex at first, are just a series of automated checks and deployments.\n\n#### **Key Lessons**\n\n1. **Leverage AI for speed, but maintain structure**: AI can scaffold code fast, but without proper API contracts (OpenAPI), testing (unit + integration), and containerization, it falls apart at scale\n\n2. **APIs are the contract**: OpenAPI specs bridge frontend and backend teams/tools — treat them seriously\n\n3. **Testing isn't optional**: Unit tests catch bugs, integration tests catch integration bugs. Both matter\n\n4. **Containerization enables reproducibility**: Docker/Compose makes \"it works on my machine\" a non-issue\n\n5. **Automation frees mental energy**: CI/CD means you can focus on features, not manual testing and deployment\n\n6. **End-to-end thinking**: You can't just build a feature in isolation anymore. You need to think: frontend → API → backend → database → tests → deployment\n\n#### **Mindset Shift**\n\nWeek 1 taught me AI tools exist. Week 2 taught me **how to think like a real engineer** using those tools: designing APIs, writing tests, containerizing, and automating. It's the difference between \"I can generate code\" and \"I can ship production applications.\"\n\n**Homework:** [End-to-End Project - Online Coding Interview Platform](https://github.com/oussou-dev/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp/tree/main/02_code_itws)\n\nThe app can be able to do the following:\n\n- Create a link and share it with candidates\n- Allow everyone who connects to edit code in the code panel\n- Show real-time updates to all connected users\n- Support syntax highlighting for multiple languages\n- Execute code safely in the browser\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Course Overview\n\nThis page documents my progress in the [AI Dev Tools by Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp) course.\n\n## Week 1: Introduction, Setup & AI Tools Overview\n\n![](/img/week_1_ai_dev_tools.png)\n\n\n### Goals\n- Set up the environment\n- Introduction to AI development tools\n- \n- AI-assisted development with Snake game example (React + JS)\n- Chat applications: ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Microsoft Copilot\n- Coding assistants / IDEs: Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Pear\n- Project bootstrappers: Bolt, Lovable\n- Agents: Anthropic Computer Use, PR Agent, others\n- Homework : build a Todo app in Django using AI tools\n\n\n### Recap - Week 1\nThis first week of the AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp helped me lay the foundations of AI-assisted coding — i.e. adopting tools and workflows that make code writing faster, cleaner, and more efficient.
