    "text": "week_1\n\n\n\n\n\nSet up the environment.\nIntroduction to AI development tools.\n\nThis first week of the AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp helped me lay the foundations of AI-assisted coding — i.e. adopting tools and workflows that make code writing faster, cleaner, and more efficient. Here are the main takeaways:\nThe course introduced me to the concept of “Vibe Coding” — leveraging AI assistants, coding-assist tools, project bootstrappers, and even automated agents to accelerate development rather than reinvent the wheel.\nI discovered a concrete landscape of current tools: AI-powered code assistants / IDEs (like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, etc.), as well as project generators (“bootstrappers”) such as Bolt or Lovable, which let you rapidly scaffold a new app.\nThe methodology is hands-on: right away we work on a small project (a Snake game in React + JS), using these AI tools to see their real benefit in a development context.\nA key message from the course: you don’t need prior AI knowledge to begin. If you already know a programming language (Python, JavaScript…), that’s enough to start benefiting from AI assistants.\nWhat struck me: the potential of a modern, AI-integrated dev workflow — combining assistants, agents, automation — to reduce friction, speed up prototyping or production phases, and free mental bandwidth for architecture, business logic, and code quality.\nIn short — Week 1 helped me shift away from the “hand-code everything” paradigm toward a more fluid, developer-AI collaborative approach that feels well-suited for modern software projects."
